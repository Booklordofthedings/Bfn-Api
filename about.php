            <div class="card-body">This website is <b>not officially affiliated with EA, Popcap or the Plants vs Zombies property</b> and is a unmonetized fan project using the BfN api. <br>
                The api is currently not being maintained, so <b>there will not be any new features nor is there a guarantee that the website will work in the future.</b> <br>
                Support for the nintendo switch version of the game will not happen. <br>
                In order for any of your stats to be available you <b>need to activate the public sharing of your stats in the ingame settings. </b> <br>
                This makes your stats publicly available to anyone knowing your ingame name and the platform you play on if you wish to keep your stats private you can deactivate the public sharing of your stats in the ingame settings. <br>
                We do not store any personally identifiying information or use cookies. In order for our website to be able to work under load we do need to store (chache) the actual data of your stats on our servers. <br>
                We use hashes to privatice your data and make it impossible for us to identify you based on the stored stats. If you wish to have your stats removed from our servers you can contact us via email. <br>
